# Data Science Bootcamp: Introduction to Pandas + Plotly
This is the DataRes Fall 2021 Workshop Introducing Pandas and Plotly.

## Instructions to get Started
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
   - On a terminal/command line, you can execute the command `python --version` and it will tell you which version you have if installed. If you do not, follow [these instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Make sure you have jupyter notebook installed on your computer
   - On a terminal/command line, you can execute the command `jupyter --version` and it will tell you which version you have if installed. If you do not have jupyter installed, follow these steps of installation for [Getting started with the classic Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install). You can use either pip or conda to install depending on which package manager you prefer to use.
3. Make sure you have a [Github account](https://github.com/)
4. Go to this github repository and either clone, fork, or download it
   - You can fork a repository by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), or 
   - you can clone the repository by using the terminal with the command `git clone [insert copied http link]` or 
   - *(what I recommend)* download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and use that to clone your repository.
   - If this is too complex, you can also directly download the repository by pressing the download zip button
5. On the terminal or command line, run the command `jupyter notebook`. This command should open a tab on your browser where you can create new notebooks.
6. Identify the downloaded/cloned/forked folder in your jupyter notebook to ensure you have it for the meeting.
   - The structure of the jupyter browser is essentially a replica of your file system, so you can navigate through it and see all the files you have in documents, downloads, etc. such as you would using Finder or Libraries
7. If you are not familiar with Python, watch this [30 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QDvkkdyGw0) (or read any Python man pages) for an introduction to Python
8. Finally, make sure you have plotly installed and pandas installed
   - You can run the command `pip list` if you use pip, or run `conda list` if you use conda, to show all the packages you have installed for Python. If you do not see either pandas or plotly, follow the instructions to install [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) or [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/).
